<!-- I recommend that you immediately start to write your own blog entries. You could write a short entry every time you learned something new about programming. For inspiration I list a few things that you could write about:

What did I learn today?
Insert screenshots
Links to helpful websites
What are the problems I have encountered?
How did I solve these problems?
What should I work on the next time?
With such blog entries you will advance much faster in mastering programming. This is why:

You will be aware of what you have learned â†’ higher motivation!
You can look up things in your personal documentation, for example links to helpful sites.
You will practice HTML and CSS while writing the entries.
If you publish your website online you can make your blog accessible to others. This enables you to share your knowledge or to ask someone to help you with a problem. -->
